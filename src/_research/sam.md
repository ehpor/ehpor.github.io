In 2013 we designed and implemented a Michelson interferometry observing mode called Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM) or Non-Redundant Masking (NRM) at optical wavelengths on the student telescope located in the Westkoepel in the Leiden Old Observatory. The telescope was transformed into a seven-element interferometer using an aperture mask located in front of the primary mirror.

Methods for designing this mask are discussed. A data-reduction pipeline was written in Python and the whole setup was validated using first-light observations of a 3 magnitude contrast binary at 1.5 λ/D separation.

Algorithms for creating Kolmogorov phase screens involved in simulations are also discussed. This involves
