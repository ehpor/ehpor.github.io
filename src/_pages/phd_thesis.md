The next generation of high-contrast imaging instruments on space-based observatories requires sophisticated wavefront sensing and control in addition to a high-performance coronagraph. This thesis aims to further our knowledge of coronagraphs and their integration into high-contrast imaging instruments.

Chapter 2 presents a new algorithm for global optimization of the apodizing phase plate coronagraph. Chapters 3 and 4 present the theory, design and laboratory results of the SCAR coronagraph, which uses a phase plate and single-mode fibers. Chapter 5 presents the development of HCIPy, a software package in Python for high-contrast imaging. Chapters 7 and 8 present the theory, design and laboratory results of the PAPLC coronagraph, which uses a phase plate, knife-edge focal-plane mask and Lyot stop, and an integrated high-order wavefront sensor.

These new coronagraphy and wavefront sensing concepts pave the way for improved high-contrast imaging instruments, both from ground-based and space-based observatories.

## defense

I successfully defended my PhD dissertation on Friday, December 11, 2020 at 12:30 CET at the Academie building in Leiden. I wore a heartrate monitor on that day. Here are the results, annotated with significant events.
