Emiel Por started his education at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy) with a double Bachelor’s degree in Physics and Astronomy in 2013 and a Master’s degree in Astronomical Instrumentation in 2016. He continued at Leiden University and received his [PhD](/phd_thesis/) in Astronomy in December 2020. In 2021 he started as a Sagan fellow at the [Space Telescope Science Institute](https://stsci.edu).

Emiel’s research focuses on advanced instrumentation for the direct imaging of exoplanets for both ground- and space-based telescopes. He develops novel coronagraph solutions and methods for post-coronagraphic wavefront sensing. Segmented primary mirrors, such as the one proposed for LUVOIR, require that all segments stay aligned to within a few picometers during a coronagraphic observation. Therefore, besides a high-performance coronagraph, high-order wavefront sensing and control will be necessary for future giant segmented space telescopes. As an NHFP Sagan fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute, Emiel works on developing novel coronagraph solutions that jointly optimize both contrast and wavefront sensing and control.
